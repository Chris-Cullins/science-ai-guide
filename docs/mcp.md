# MCP and Connectors (Advanced)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a way for agentic tools to use external tools and data sources.

Examples of what connectors can enable:

- read Google Drive docs
- pull issues from Jira/GitHub
- use internal datasets or search indexes

## Why scientists should care

The biggest productivity wins often come from connecting the agent to your actual working context:

- lab docs
- protocols
- shared notes
- code repos

## The risk

More access increases blast radius.

Rules of thumb:

- start with read-only
- avoid connecting anything sensitive until you understand the permissions
- log what the agent did

If your institution has policies, follow them.
