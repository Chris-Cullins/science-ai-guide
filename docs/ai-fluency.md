- Add one tiny sanity check.

## Day 3: Convert one notebook

- Turn one notebook into a script + config.
- Require identical outputs.

## Day 4: Refactor for a new lab member

- Improve README.
- Pin dependencies.
- One-command run.

## Day 5: Literature workflow

- Summarize 3 papers you provide.
- Produce a comparison table of assumptions and failure modes.

## Day 6: Writing workflow

- Use AI for clarity-only editing.
- Verify every claim.

## Day 7: Make a lab policy

- Fill in: [Lab Policy Template](lab-policy-template.md)

If you do just this week, you will be far ahead of most people.
