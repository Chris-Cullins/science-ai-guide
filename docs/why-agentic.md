# Why Agentic AI (Instead of Chat)

Chat-only AI is useful for:

- explaining concepts
- brainstorming
- writing help

But for real research work, the friction is often:

- your messy file system
- inconsistent scripts
- environment setup
- refactors and reproducibility

Agentic tools reduce that friction because they can:

- inspect your project structure
- edit the actual files
- run commands (tests, scripts)
- iterate until it works

## The real shift

Your job becomes less "do every step" and more:

- define the goal
- define constraints
- verify the result

That is a managerial skill, not a coding trick.

## When NOT to use agentic AI

- Sensitive data you are not allowed to share
- High-stakes decisions without verification (clinical, safety-critical)
- Tasks where you cannot define a test or check

If you cannot verify it, do not delegate it.
