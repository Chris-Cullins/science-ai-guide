# Agentic AI for Scientists

This guide is for scientists who are *not* professional software developers, but who do write code, analyze data, and produce papers.

The core idea: instead of using an AI model like a chat box, you use an *agent* that can take actions (read/write files, run commands, iterate) with you supervising.

2. [Why Agentic AI](why-agentic.md)
3. [Pick Your Tools](tooling.md)
4. [Oh I Get It (Guided Tour)](oh-i-get-it.md)
5. [Bootcamp (2 Days)](bootcamp.md)
6. [Quick Win (First Hour)](first-hour.md)
7. [Workflows (Plan-Do-Verify)](workflows.md)
8. [Verification and Rigor](verification.md)

If you are leading a lab:

1. [Lab Rollout](lab-rollout.md)
2. [Lab Policy Template](lab-policy-template.md)
3. [Reproducibility](reproducibility.md)
4. [Safety, Privacy, and Policy](safety-privacy.md)

## Where to start

1. Install and try Claude Code on a small, non-sensitive project: [Claude Code](claude-code.md)
2. Learn the core workflow loop (plan -> do -> verify): [Workflows](workflows.md)
3. Set guardrails for privacy, safety, and reproducibility: [Safety & Privacy](safety-privacy.md)
4. Copy/paste prompt templates you can actually use: [Prompt Templates](prompts.md)
5. Understand costs and avoid surprises: [Pricing](pricing.md)

If you are onboarding a lab:

- First hour checklist: [First Hour](first-hour.md)
- Lab rollout: [Lab Rollout](lab-rollout.md)
- Disclosure/attribution: [Disclosure](disclosure.md)
- Reproducibility habits: [Reproducibility](reproducibility.md)

## A quick mental model

- Chat-only AI: you ask questions; you copy/paste results.
- Agentic AI: you give a task; it edits files and runs commands; you review diffs and outputs.

If you can supervise work and verify results, agentic tools can compress days of "yak shaving" (setup, plumbing, debugging, refactors) into hours.
