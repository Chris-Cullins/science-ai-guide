# Why This Guide Exists

This guide started from a YouTube video transcript: `transcript_PctlBxRh0p4.md` (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctlBxRh0p4).

In that transcript, a scientist describes attending an internal meeting at the Institute for Advanced Study focused on how "agentic AI" tools (named examples: Claude and Cursor) are changing research work. Several themes show up repeatedly:

- The tools are now strong enough at coding (and often math/reasoning) to materially change day-to-day research workflows.
- Getting value requires *AI fluency*: learning how to define tasks, break problems down, and iterate.
- Human oversight is still necessary (diff review, cross-checks, validation), but the human role shifts toward "manager / verifier."
- Privacy, ethics, and cost are real concerns; people will make different tradeoffs.
- Skill atrophy is a legitimate risk; you need deliberate habits to stay sharp.

This guide tries to turn those themes into concrete, low-friction steps a working scientist can apply.
