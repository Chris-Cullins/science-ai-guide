# Open a Terminal (macOS, Windows, Linux)

Agentic tools like Claude Code run in a terminal.

If you have never used one, that's normal. This page gets you to a working prompt.

## macOS

Built-in Terminal (fastest)

1. Press Command + Space (Spotlight Search)
2. Type: Terminal
3. Press Enter

Alternative terminals (optional)

- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)

Any of these work. Pick one and stick with it.

## Windows

Windows Terminal (recommended)

1. Press the Windows key
2. Type: Windows Terminal
3. Press Enter

Then choose one shell:

- PowerShell (common default)
- Command Prompt (cmd)

If you need Linux-style tooling

- Install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and use an Ubuntu shell inside Windows Terminal.

## Linux

Most desktop Linux distributions include a terminal.

Common ways to open it:

- Press Ctrl + Alt + T (works on many distros)
- Use the application launcher and search for: Terminal

## A quick sanity check

Once the terminal opens, type:

```bash
pwd
```

If it prints a folder path, you are good.
