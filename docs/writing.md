# Writing and Grants

AI is very good at clarity and structure.
It is also very good at sounding confident while being wrong.

## Safe uses

- rewrite for clarity
- improve structure
- tighten abstract/intro
- generate outlines

## Risky uses

- adding claims
- adding citations
- summarizing things you did not provide as sources

## A workflow that works

1. You provide the facts (results, figures, key points).
2. The AI improves clarity and structure.
3. You verify every claim.

## A good prompt

```text
Edit for clarity and structure only.

Rules:
- Do not add citations.
- Do not change scientific claims.
- If something is unclear, ask questions instead of guessing.
```
