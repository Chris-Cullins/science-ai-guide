# Pick Your Tools

There is no single best tool. Choose based on your comfort level, your workflow, and your institution.

## Recommended default: Claude Code

Why:

- works in a terminal (fits research workflows)
- edits files and runs commands
- good at larger refactors and multi-step tasks

Start here: [Claude Code](claude-code.md)

## Alternatives (common)

- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/): AI-first code editor with agent features
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot): agent/chat inside IDEs + GitHub
- [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex): coding agent that runs in your terminal

## What matters more than the tool

- Your verification habits
- A reproducible project structure
- Good prompts that define constraints and "done"

## Suggested stack for a typical lab

- Agentic coding: Claude Code
- General assistant + deep research: whichever your institution supports
- Version control: Git + GitHub (or your institution's GitLab)
- Reproducibility: pinned environments + a one-command run
