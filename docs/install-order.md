# Installation Order (Recommended)

There are many tools. Installing everything at once creates confusion.

## Recommended order

1. Start with one chat tool you already use.
   - Use it for planning, explanations, and writing.
2. Add one agentic tool that can edit files and run commands.
   - Recommended: Claude Code.
   - If you already pay for ChatGPT, consider [OpenAI Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)
3. Only then add an IDE-based agent (optional).
   - Example: Cursor or Copilot in your IDE.
4. Add multi-model workflows only after you have verification habits.

## Why this order works

- Most failures come from weak workflow and verification, not from "the wrong model".
- Agentic tools amplify your habits.

## Minimum setup for a scientist

- A repo (git)
- A virtual environment
- A one-command run
- A sanity check
