# Disclosure and Attribution

Norms are evolving. Your field, journal, and institution may have specific policies.

## Safe default

- Disclose meaningful AI assistance (especially if it generated text, code, or figures).
- Do not list an AI system as an author.
- Do not allow AI to invent citations; verify every reference.

## Suggested disclosure language (adapt)

```text
We used AI-assisted tools to help with code refactoring and/or drafting text. All scientific claims, analyses, and final wording were reviewed and verified by the authors.
```

If a journal has a specific required statement, use theirs.
