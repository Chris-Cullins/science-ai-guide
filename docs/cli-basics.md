# Terminal Basics (For Non-Developers)

You do not need to become a software engineer. But agentic tools often live in the terminal.

## Three commands you should know

```bash
pwd   # where am I?
ls    # what files are here?
cd .. # go up one folder
```

## Paths

- A "path" is just a file location.
- `.` means "current folder".
- `..` means "parent folder".

## A safe habit

Before you run any command you do not recognize:

1. ask the agent what it will do
2. run it on a copy of the project first

## Common research commands

```bash
python3 script.py
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

If those look unfamiliar, that is normal. You only need a small subset.
