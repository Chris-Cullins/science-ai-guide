# Safety, Privacy, and Policy

This is the "don't get fired / don't leak data / don't fool yourself" page.

## Defaults (recommended)

- Don't put unpublished results, sensitive human-subject data, credentials, or embargoed material into any tool unless your institution explicitly allows it.
- Treat AI output as *untrusted* until you verify it.
- Prefer working in a repository with version control so you can review diffs.

## Human oversight

Even if agentic AI can do a lot, you still need to:

- inspect diffs
- run checks
- validate math and statistics
- verify citations and claims

## Common failure modes

- Confident wrong answers (especially on niche domain facts)
- "Looks right" plots with incorrect preprocessing
- Silent changes in assumptions (units, coordinate conventions)
- Fake citations
