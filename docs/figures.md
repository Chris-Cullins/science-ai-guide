# Figures and Tables

Figures are where incorrect code becomes persuasive.

## The standard

- One command regenerates figures.
- Every figure has a clear source script.
- Inputs and parameters are recorded.

## A useful pattern

- `scripts/make_fig_2.py`
- `configs/fig_2.yaml`
- `results/fig_2.png`

## Verification checks

- plot a small random subsample to ensure it behaves
- include axis labels and units
- store intermediate summaries (counts, means) for sanity
