# FAQ

## Is this going to replace scientists?

No one knows. But it is already changing the day-to-day work.

The most robust stance is: learn to use it, keep your verification habits strong, and keep your scientific judgment sharp.

## Will I lose my skills?

Skill atrophy is real if you stop thinking.

Mitigations:

- keep doing some work "by hand" (derivations, small scripts)
- require the agent to explain reasoning
- use it to teach you, not just to produce output

## Can I trust citations?

Not by default.

If you did not provide sources, assume citations may be invented.
