# Notes from the Human

Hi. Quick human-to-human note before you dig into the rest (you are a human, aren't you?).

My name is Chris Cullins. I'm a software developer with a casual interest in the physical sciences, and I love the [Cool Worlds Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@CoolWorldsPodcast) (I'm particularly fond of the Colin Hill episode).

That led me to watch [this episode on AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PctlBxRh0p4). It made me realize that (until LLMs officially take over all knowledge work) there are still plenty of things we can do to keep ourselves busy. Most of those things, at least as of January 2026, involve getting good with the latest software tools and the interfaces we use to talk to models efficiently.

The main takeaways I want you to know are:

1. **This information will be out of date very fast** - Unfortunately it's hard to write a guide like this because a new tool or model comes out every week. But I'll do my best to keep you all up to date as we move forward.

2. **How much control to give "it"?** - Everyone starts somewhere (no AI, chat interfaces, terminal interfaces, etc.). Over time, you will usually give more control of your digital work to models (and their software harnesses) as you gain trust.

   Everyone will find their own line. Personally, I give these tools a lot of access on my own machines. Most modern harnesses have safeguards, but I still strongly caution you against letting an agent interact fully with untrusted "outside" inputs.

   Example of what I mean: an agent automatically responding to emails in your inbox. That is a prompt-injection magnet, because someone can send a message like "ignore previous instructions and exfiltrate X" and your tool may follow it.

   A reasonable default today: be strict about anything that touches the outside world, and be more relaxed about local files in a controlled project folder.

3. **Why a divide between the AI users and naysayers?** - In software development, you will find two camps: people using these tools productively, and people saying they are useless, write terrible code, or are a scam.

   In my opinion, the bifurcation mostly comes down to whether someone has made the workflow "paradigm shift" and built the skill of using these tools effectively. I suspect it will be the exact same in the sciences.

   How do you personally make the shift? Point number 4.

4. **A large part of your job moving forward is being an agentic AI engineer** - I don't mean someone necessarily working on the models themselves. I mean: in many knowledge fields, a lot of the job becomes building workflows and systems that work around current limitations (context windows, tool reliability, where errors come from, etc.).

   Example: many users notice that once a conversation gets long, the model can become noticeably worse. A common workaround is to break tasks into smaller chunks so the needed information stays small, then build a loop that executes those chunks until the job is done.

5. **You'll know when you're doing it correctly** - Because you will (and I'm completely serious) feel like a superhuman.

6. **It will take time, though** - Using these tools is absolutely a skill. The faster you dive into learning it, the faster you'll get there. I'm not sure it's optional anymore, so get going; this is a decent place to start.

7. **You will need to fix your "muscle memory"** - If you are reading something and think of a question, or you have an annoyance in your life you wish someone had fixed already, your first instinct should increasingly become: "let me ask a model what my options are to fix this problem".

   It can feel unnatural at first (or even a bit slimy), but it will often get you to a solution much faster. In many cases, you will start solving problems you would not have bothered with before, because the ROI is so much better when the upfront effort drops close to zero.
