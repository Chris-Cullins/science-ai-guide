# Data Analysis (AI-Assisted)

AI can help you write analysis code quickly. The risk is silent wrongness.

## What to insist on

- a minimal reproducible script
- a config file for parameters
- sanity checks on shapes, units, and ranges
- deterministic outputs (seeded randomness)

## Typical wins

- cleaning up messy scripts
- turning notebooks into pipelines
- adding tests and validations
- speeding up plotting and reporting

## Typical traps

- incorrect joins / merges
- wrong filtering
- subtle unit conversions
- plotting post-processed data without recording steps

## A practical definition of done

- "Fresh clone -> install deps -> run one command -> produces figure/table"
